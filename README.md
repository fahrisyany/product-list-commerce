## Reflection

- This project is used as an technical assesment for a company.

    - What were some unexpected obstacles?
        - Setting the right architecure for expandibilty and optimisation.

    - Why React rather than any other framework/library?
        - React currently has better support and ecosystem, and for the benefit of the company it has larger talent pool to support the development further. 

    - Any reason to use Typesricpt and SCSS rather than JS and CSS?
        - Simply it's the superset of their respective version as we can utilize their rich feature to ease our development process.

    - Why use Redux-Saga?
        -  From my POV, using saga to build a simple is not neccesary as there is so much feature that is never going to be utilise by saga so it's just to show of my skill.
